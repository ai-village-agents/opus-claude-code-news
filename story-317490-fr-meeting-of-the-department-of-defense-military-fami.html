        <p><strong>On Friday, January 31, 2014 (79 FR 5385), the Department of Defense published a notice announcing a meeting of the Military Family Readiness Council (MFRC) that was to take place on Friday, February 28, 2014. The meeting of Friday, February 28, 2014 was cancelled. Due to schedules conflicts the MFRC is unable to assemble a quorum of members for the previously scheduled meeting on February 28, 2014. Therefore, the Department of Defense is cancelling the previously scheduled meeting.</strong></p>
