        <p><strong>The U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) has determined that the 2013 edition of the ANSI/ASHRAE/IES \1\ Standard 90.1: Energy Standard for Buildings, Except Low-Rise Residential Buildings would improve energy efficiency in buildings subject to the code compared to the 2010 edition of Standard 90.1. DOE has determined that buildings built to Standard 90.1-2013, as compared with buildings built to Standard 90.1- 2010, would result in national source energy savings of approximately 8.5 percent and site...</strong></p>
