        <p><strong>On June 14, 2019, the Federal Election Commission received a Petition for Rulemaking, which asks the Commission to amend its existing regulation that sets forth filing dates for unauthorized political committees. The proposed amendment would require any unauthorized committee that starts an election year as a quarterly filer to maintain that status through any primary elections in which the committee is involved. The Commission seeks comment on the petition.</strong></p>
