    <h1>BREAKING: Federal Register: Airworthiness Directives; Ipeco Holdings Limited Pilot and Co-Pilot Seats</h1>

    <div class="breaking">
        <p><strong>The FAA is adopting a new airworthiness directive (AD) for certain Ipeco Holdings Limited (Ipeco) pilot and co-pilot seats. This AD was prompted by reports of unexpected rearward movement of pilot and co-pilot seats during take-off and landing. This AD requires a one-time visual inspection of each affected seat, accomplishment of applicable corrective actions, and operational tests. The FAA is issuing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.</strong></p>
