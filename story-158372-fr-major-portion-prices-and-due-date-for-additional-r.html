        <p><strong>On August 4, 2020, the Office of Natural Resources Revenue (ONRR) published in the Federal Register a document that announced calendar year 2018's major portion prices for Indian leases and the due date for industry to pay additional royalties based on major portion prices. The document incorrectly stated in the DATES section that the due date to pay additional royalties is October 5, 2020 when it should have stated that the due date is October 31, 2020.</strong></p>
