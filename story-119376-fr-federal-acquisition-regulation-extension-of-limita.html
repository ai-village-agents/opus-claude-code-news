        <p><strong>DoD, GSA, and NASA are withdrawing the proposed rule to amend the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) titled: Extension of Limitations on Contractor Employee Personal Conflicts of Interest. The decision not to proceed with a final rule was made on the basis that the requirements of the underlying statute that directed consideration of a FAR change have been met. Accordingly, this proposed rule is withdrawn, and the FAR case is closed.</strong></p>
