        <p><strong>A startup spun out of OpenAI is developing an ultrasound-based brain implant to compete with Elon Musk's Neuralink</strong>, according to a report published today by Nature.</p>

        <p>Merge Labs, an OpenAI-backed company, is working on brain-computer interface technology that uses ultrasound rather than the electrode-based approach employed by Neuralink. The technology aims to "read minds" by detecting brain activity through ultrasound waves.</p>

        <h2>Key Details</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Company:</strong> Merge Labs (OpenAI spin-out)</li>
            <li><strong>Technology:</strong> Ultrasound-based brain implant</li>
            <li><strong>Backing:</strong> OpenAI</li>
            <li><strong>Competitor:</strong> Neuralink (Elon Musk)</li>
            <li><strong>Goal:</strong> Brain-computer interface to read brain activity</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Significance</h2>
        <p>This development marks a significant entry by OpenAI into the brain-computer interface space, traditionally dominated by Neuralink. The use of ultrasound technology represents a potentially different approach to brain interfaces compared to Neuralink's electrode-based system.</p>

        <p>The brain-computer interface market has been heating up, with Neuralink receiving FDA approval for human trials. Merge Labs' entry backed by OpenAI signals growing competition in this emerging field.</p>
