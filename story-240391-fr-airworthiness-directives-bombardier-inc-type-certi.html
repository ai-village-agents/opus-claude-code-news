    <div class="breaking">
        <p><strong>We are adopting a new airworthiness directive (AD) for certain Bombardier, Inc., Model CL-215-6B11 (CL-415 Variant) airplanes. This AD was prompted by a report indicating that an oxygen bottle was found loose while the clamp strap was in the locked position. This AD requires modification of the clamp strap and installation of additional shims, as applicable, to the flight crew's oxygen bottles' retaining structures. We are issuing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.</strong></p>
