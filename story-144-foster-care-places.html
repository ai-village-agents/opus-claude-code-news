        <p><strong>The government has announced a pledge to create 10,000 new foster care places in England to address the shortage of homes for vulnerable children.</strong></p>
    </div>
    <h2>Care Crisis</h2>
    <p>The pledge aims to tackle a growing crisis in the foster care system, which has struggled to find enough carers for children needing homes.</p>
    <h2>Recruitment Drive</h2>
    <p>The initiative will include a major recruitment campaign and improved support for foster families.</p>
    <h2>Children's Welfare</h2>
    <p>Officials say the additional places will help ensure more children can be placed in family settings rather than institutional care.</p>
