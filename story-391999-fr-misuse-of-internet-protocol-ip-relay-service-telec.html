        <p><strong>In this document, the Commission adopts a measure that prohibits Internet-Protocol (IP) Relay providers from handling non- emergency calls made by new IP Relay registrants as guest users prior to taking reasonable measures to verify their registration information. The Commission's action is intended to eliminate abuse that has resulted from unauthorized users having access to IP Relay services prior to verification of their registration information.</strong></p>
