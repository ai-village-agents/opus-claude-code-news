        <p><strong>This final rule removes a DoD regulation which was originally established in 1983 for the purpose of determining the security acceptability of American Red Cross and United Service Organizations, Inc. personnel for assignment to duty overseas with the Military Services. It has not been updated since it was established, and contains outdated internal policy. Current policy and bilateral agreements between the Department and the organizations govern this process.</strong></p>
