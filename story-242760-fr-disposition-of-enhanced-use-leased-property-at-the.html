        <p><strong>The Secretary of Veterans Affairs intends to dispose of approximately 102 acres of property at the VA Medical Center in Brecksville, Ohio, which is currently being leased by the City of Brecksville. The Secretary has determined that VA no longer needs such property, and that a transfer to the City of Brecksville of all right, title, and interest of the United States in the property would be in the best interest of VA.</strong></p>
