        <p><strong>The Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) published a document in the Federal Register on August 27, 2019, concerning a notice of applications. As that document correctly indicated, each of the applicants noticed applied to be registered with DEA to grow marihuana as a bulk manufacturer. However, certain drug codes for some of the applicants were inadvertently omitted by DEA or not listed because applicants had inadvertently omitted them from their applications.</strong></p>
