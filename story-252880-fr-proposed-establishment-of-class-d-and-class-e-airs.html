        <p><strong>This action proposes to establish Class D airspace and Class E surface area airspace at Lake City, FL, providing the controlled airspace required for the Air Traffic Control Tower at Lake City Gateway Airport. This action also would amend existing Class E airspace by recognizing the airport's name change. Controlled airspace is necessary for the safety and management of instrument flight rules (IFR) operations at the airport.</strong></p>
