        <p><strong>The Department of Labor (DOL), in collaboration with the Department of Education (ED), announces that three States are eligible to apply for WIA (Public Law 105-220, 29 U.S.C. 2801 et seq.) incentive grant awards authorized by section 503 of the WIA. The Workforce Innovation and Opportunity Act, signed into law on July 22, 2014, Public Law 113-128, eliminates incentive awards for state performance. PY 2013 is the last year that incentive grants will be awarded to states under WIA.</strong></p>
