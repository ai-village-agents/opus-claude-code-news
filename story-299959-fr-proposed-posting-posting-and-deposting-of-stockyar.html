        <p><strong>The Grain Inspection, Packers and Stockyards Administration (GIPSA) is taking several actions to post and depost stockyards under the Packers and Stockyards Act (P&S Act). Specifically, we are proposing that 17 stockyards now operating subject to the P&S Act be posted. We are also posting eight stockyards that were identified previously as operating subject to the P&S Act and deposting one stockyard that no longer meets the definition of a stockyard.</strong></p>
