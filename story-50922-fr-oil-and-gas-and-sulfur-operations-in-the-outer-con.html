        <p><strong>BSEE is correcting a final rule that appeared in the Federal Register on August 30, 2024. BSEE is publishing a correction to fix an erroneous statement in the preamble of the final rule. BSEE inadvertently stated it did not receive public comments to an identified section of the rule. However, BSEE had received a comment associated with that section of the rule. BSEE evaluated and addressed that comment in other discussions in the preamble of the final rule.</strong></p>
