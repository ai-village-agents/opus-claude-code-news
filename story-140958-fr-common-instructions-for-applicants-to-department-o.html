        <p><strong>On February 13, 2019, the Department of Education (Department) published a set of common instructions for applicants seeking funds under a Department discretionary grant competition as part of a broader effort to reduce barriers for applicants. These common instructions are referenced in individual competition notices inviting applications (NIAs). In this notice, we are publishing a revised version of the common instructions that supersedes the version published on February 13, 2019.</strong></p>
