        <p><strong>The Coast Guard is adopting a 2017 interim rule involving four anchorage grounds on the Lower Mississippi River below Baton Rouge as a final rule. The interim rule established two anchorage grounds and revised two others which increased the available anchorage grounds necessary to accommodate vessel traffic. After considering comments on that rule we have decided to adopt it as final without change which now completes this rulemaking.</strong></p>
