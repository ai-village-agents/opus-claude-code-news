        <p><strong>The National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences (NIEHS)/National Toxicology Program (NTP) requests comments on a set of human genes that have been identified and prioritized as environmentally responsive genes. These genes will be used in toxicogenomics approaches to screen cells or tissues obtained from humans against large numbers of chemicals. The goal was to generate a set of approximately 1500 human genes to evaluate transcriptional changes in response to chemical exposures. Similar...</strong></p>
