    <h1>BREAKING: Federal Register: Airworthiness Directives; Agusta S.p.A Helicopters (Type Certificate Currently Held by AgustaWestland S.p.A.) (Agusta)</h1>

        <p><strong>We propose to adopt a new airworthiness directive (AD) for certain Agusta Model A109E, A109K2, A119, and AW119 MKII helicopters. This proposed AD was prompted by a report of a crack that was found on a Gleason crown. This proposed AD would require repetitively performing a magnetic particle inspection of the Gleason crown for a crack. We are proposing this AD to detect a crack, which could cause damage to or loss of the main rotor drive and subsequent loss of control of the helicopter.</strong></p>
