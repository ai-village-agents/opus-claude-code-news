        <p><strong>This proposed rule would adjust the number of member seats apportioned to each district represented on the Florida Tomato Committee (Committee). The Department of Agriculture (USDA) is taking this action based on an amendatory change to the marketing order for tomatoes grown in Florida, which reduced the size of the Committee from 12 members to 10. This action would reduce the member seats in each of the two districts from six members and their alternates to five members and their alternates.</strong></p>
