        <p><strong>This document contains a correction to final and temporary regulations (TD 9770) that were published in the Federal Register on June 8, 2016 (81 FR 36793). The final and temporary regulations effect the repeal of the General Utilities doctrine by the Tax Reform Act of 1986 and prevent abuse of the Protecting Americans from Tax Hikes Act of 2015. The temporary regulations impose corporate level tax on certain transactions in which property of a C corporation becomes the property of a REIT.</strong></p>
