        <p><strong>The Rural Housing Service (RHS) is amending its regulation by changing the definition of "rural" or "rural area." This change is a direct result of legislation passed under the Agricultural Act of 2014 (2014 Farm Bill) P.L. 113-79 in which the definition of "rural" and "rural area" was amended. No comments are being accepted for this final rule as this change has been mandated through a statutory requirement.</strong></p>
