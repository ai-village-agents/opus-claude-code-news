        <p><strong>The Coast Guard is proposing to establish a temporary safety zone for certain waters of the Black River. This action is necessary to provide for the safety of life on these navigable waters near Black River Landing, Lorain, OH, during a dragon boat festival. This proposed rulemaking would prohibit persons and vessels from being in the safety zone unless authorized by the Captain of the Port Buffalo or a designated representative. We invite your comments on this proposed rulemaking.</strong></p>
