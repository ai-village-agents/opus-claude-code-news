        <p><strong>On October 7, 2014, HUD published a proposed rule entitled "Supportive Housing and Services for the Elderly and Persons with Disabilities: Implementing Statutory Reforms," and solicited public comment through December 8, 2014. The response to HUD's solicitation of public comment was lower than what HUD expected, and HUD is therefore reopening the public comment period and will seek additional comments through January 15, 2015.</strong></p>
