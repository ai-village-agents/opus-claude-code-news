        <p><strong>We are giving notice of SSR 12-1p. This SSR explains our policy for evaluating whether work performed by self-employed persons who are blind is substantial gainful activity (SGA) under the disability program in title II of the Social Security Act (Act). In addition, this ruling clarifies that we do not count the income resulting from the Randolph-Sheppard Act and similar programs as earnings when we determine whether blind persons are engaging in SGA.</strong></p>
