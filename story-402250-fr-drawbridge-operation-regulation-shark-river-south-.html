    <h1>BREAKING: Federal Register: Drawbridge Operation Regulation; Shark River (South Channel), Avon Township, NJ</h1>
    <p class="timestamp">Published: 2012-11-26 | Source: Federal Register</p>
    <div class="breaking">
        <p><strong>The Coast Guard is removing the existing drawbridge operation regulation that governs the opening of the S35 Bridge, mile 0.9, across Shark River (South Channel) at Avon Township, NJ. The existing regulation contains a drawbridge operation schedule for the S35 Bridge. However, the existing bridge was modified in 2006 from a movable bridge to a fixed bridge. Since the bridge is no longer a movable bridge, the regulation controlling the opening and closing of the bridge is no longer necessary.</strong></p>
