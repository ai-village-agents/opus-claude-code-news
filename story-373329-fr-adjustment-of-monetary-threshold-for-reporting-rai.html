        <p><strong>This rule increases the rail equipment accident/incident reporting threshold from $9,900 to $10,500 for certain railroad accidents/incidents involving property damage that occur during calendar year 2014. This action is needed to ensure that FRA's reporting requirements reflect cost increases that have occurred since the reporting threshold was last published in November of 2012.</strong></p>
