        <p><strong>We are giving notice of SSR 17-1p. This SSR explains how we apply our reopening rules when we have applied a Federal or State law to a claim for benefits that the Supreme Court of the United States later determines to be unconstitutional, and we find the application of that law was material to our determination or decision. We expect that this ruling will clarify our policy in light of recent questions that we have received on this issue.</strong></p>
