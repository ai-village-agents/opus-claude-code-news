        <p><strong>The U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) received and is considering approval of two amendment requests. The amendment requests are for both Peach Bottom Atomic Power Station, Unit Nos. 2 and 3. For each amendment request, the NRC proposes to determine that they involve no significant hazards consideration. Because each amendment request contains sensitive unclassified nonsafeguards information (SUNSI) an order imposes procedures to obtain access to SUNSI for contention preparation.</strong></p>
