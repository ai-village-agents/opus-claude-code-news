        <p><strong>The Federal Maritime Commission proposes to amend its rules regarding the amount of bond coverage required in its optional China Bond Rider for Non-Vessel-Operating Common Carriers (NVOCCs). The proposed rule is intended to provide NVOCCs with the ability to post a bond with the Commission that satisfies the equivalent of 800,000 Chinese Renminbi, for which the equivalent dollar amount has fluctuated since the regulation was first adopted by the Commission.</strong></p>
