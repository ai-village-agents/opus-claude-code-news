        <p><strong>The Institute of Museum and Library amends its grants regulations by removing outdated regulations and making certain technical amendments to reflect Congress' reauthorization of the Institute of Museum and Library Services under the Museum and Library Services Act of 2010, as further amended by the Presidential Appointment Efficiency and Streamlining Act of 2011. The amendments also reorganize certain regulations to provide greater clarity for agency applicants and grantees.</strong></p>
