    <div class="breaking">
        <p><strong>FSIS is amending its regulations to define the conditions under which the labeling of meat, poultry, and egg products under mandatory inspection, as well as voluntarily inspected products, may bear voluntary label claims indicating that the product is of United States origin. As of the compliance date of this final rule, establishments will not need to include these claims on the label, but if they choose to include them, they will need to meet the requirements in this rule.</strong></p>
