        <p><strong>The U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) withdraws a proposed determination published June 15, 2011 that set-top boxes (STBs) and network equipment qualify as a covered product under Part A of Title III of the Energy Policy and Conservation Act (EPCA), as amended. DOE is taking this action in light of a consensus agreement entered by a broadly representative group that DOE believes has the potential to achieve significant energy savings in STBs.</strong></p>
