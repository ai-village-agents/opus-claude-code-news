        <p><strong>The Department of Health and Human Services published a document containing technical amendments in the Federal Register on January 20, 2016, revising the Uniform Administrative Requirements, Cost Principles and Audit Requirements for HHS Awards. That document inadvertently failed to update the following: A provision in Appendix II; an improper citation; a recent OMB change; and a grammatical error. This document makes correcting amendments to correct these sections.</strong></p>
