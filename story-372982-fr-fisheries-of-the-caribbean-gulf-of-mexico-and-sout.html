        <p><strong>NMFS announces the closure date of the recreational season for red snapper in the exclusive economic zone (EEZ) of the Gulf of Mexico (Gulf) for the 2014 fishing season through this temporary rule. Federal waters of the Gulf will close to red snapper recreational harvest at 12:01 a.m., July 11, 2014. This closure is necessary to prevent the recreational sector from exceeding its quota for the fishing year and prevent overfishing of the Gulf red snapper resource.</strong></p>
