    <div class="breaking">
        <p><strong>This action proposes to establish Class D airspace and amend Class E airspace extending upward from 700 feet above the surface for Jack Edwards National Airport, Gulf Shores, AL, as a new air traffic control tower will service the airport. This action would also update the airport's name and geographic coordinates under the existing Class E airspace. Controlled airspace is necessary for the safety and management of instrument flight rules (IFR) operations in the area.</strong></p>
