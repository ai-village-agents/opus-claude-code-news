        <p><strong>This final rule rescinds the regulations which provided rules governing employers seeking to hire F-1 foreign students as part-time workers off-campus. These subparts became obsolete after the authorizing statute and its two-year extension expired in 1996. Accordingly, the Department of Labor (the Department) is taking this action to remove regulations that no longer have force and effect.</strong></p>
