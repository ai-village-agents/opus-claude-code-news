    <div class="breaking">
        <p><strong>SBA is amending its disaster assistance regulations to reflect a statutory change to the disaster assistance program contained in the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2012. The change extends the maximum term of an SBA disaster loan to small businesses with credit available elsewhere from three years to seven years. This direct final rule conforms the regulations to the Act by adopting the new statutory requirement without change.</strong></p>
