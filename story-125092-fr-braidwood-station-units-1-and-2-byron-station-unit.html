        <p><strong>On May 3, 2021, the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC, the Commission) solicited comments on an application for indirect transfer of licenses in the Federal Register. The public comment period was originally scheduled to close on June 2, 2021. The NRC has decided to extend the public comment period until June 23, 2021, to allow more time for members of the public to develop and submit their comments.</strong></p>
