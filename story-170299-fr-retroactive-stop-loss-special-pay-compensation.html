        <p><strong>This final rule removes DoD's regulation which contains obsolete DoD policy regarding Retroactive Stop Loss Special Pay Compensation, a program which was terminated on October 21, 2012. In accordance with law, this rule was issued to provide for Retroactive Stop Loss Special Pay. The last day for submission of claims to the Secretaries of the Military Departments was October 21, 2012. Following that date, the Secretaries concerned are not authorized to make payments.</strong></p>
