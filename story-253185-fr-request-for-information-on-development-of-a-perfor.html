        <p><strong>The National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) requests information for the development of a test protocol to evaluate the performance of closed system drug-transfer devices (CSTDs) that adopt air-cleaning technologies. CSTDs are generally available in two design types: (1) One that uses a physical barrier to block the unintended release of drug into the surrounding environment or the intake of environmental contaminants ...</strong></p>
