        <p><strong>On October 1, 2020, GSA published in the Federal Register a direct final rule entitled Remove Office of General Counsel Review for Final Payments. The rule revised internal agency approval procedures for processing a final payment for construction and building service contracts where, after 60 days, a contracting officer is unable to obtain a release of claims from a contractor. This action withdraws the rule because GSA received an adverse comment.</strong></p>
