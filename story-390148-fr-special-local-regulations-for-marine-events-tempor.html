        <p><strong>The Coast Guard is withdrawing its proposed rule concerning a temporary change of the enforcement period for a special local regulation of a recurring marine event in the Fifth Coast Guard District. The proposed rule was initiated to alter the date of the "Crystal Coast Super Boat Grand Prix," conducted on the waters of Bogue Sound near Morehead City, North Carolina. No new rulemaking will be initiated on this matter; rather, the event will be held as detailed in the existing regulation.</strong></p>
