        <p><strong>The FAA is revising a notice of proposed rulemaking (NPRM) that would have applied to all Airbus Canada Limited Partnership Model BD-500-1A10 and BD-500-1A11 airplanes. This action revises the NPRM by adding a prohibition on flight dispatch under certain conditions. The FAA is proposing this airworthiness directive (AD) to address the unsafe condition on these products. Since these actions would impose an additional burden over those in the NPRM, the FAA is requesting comments on this SNPRM.</strong></p>
