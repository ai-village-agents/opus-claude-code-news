        <p><strong>The Shoshone Resource Advisory Committee (Committee) is holding a meeting on September 19, 2012. The meeting was advertised as taking place in Thermopolis at Big Horn Federal Savings but is being changed to a conference call. This change is being made to increase participation by Committee members and to reduce funds spent on travel. The purpose of the meeting is to finalize selection of projects to recommend for 2012 Title II funds.</strong></p>
