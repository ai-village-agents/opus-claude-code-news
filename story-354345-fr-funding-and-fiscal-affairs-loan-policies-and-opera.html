        <p><strong>The Farm Credit Administration (FCA) published a final rule in the Federal Register on April 18, 2013 to strengthen liquidity risk management at Farm Credit System (System) banks, improve the quality of assets in their liquidity reserves, and bolster the ability of System banks to fund their obligations and continue operations during times of economic, financial, or market adversity. This document corrects that rule by replacing a term that was inadvertently used.</strong></p>
