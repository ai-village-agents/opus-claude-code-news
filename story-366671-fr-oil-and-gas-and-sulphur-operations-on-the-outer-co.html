        <p><strong>The Bureau of Safety and Environmental Enforcement (BSEE) is extending the public comment period on the production safety systems proposed rule, which was published in the Federal Register on August 22, 2013. The original public comment period would end October 21, 2013. However, BSEE has received multiple requests from various industry representatives to extend the comment period. The BSEE has reviewed the extension requests and determined that a 45-day comment period extension is appropriate.</strong></p>
