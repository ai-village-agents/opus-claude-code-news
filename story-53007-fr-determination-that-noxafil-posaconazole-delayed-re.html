        <p><strong>The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) is correcting a notice that appeared in the Federal Register on October 16, 2024. The document announced that NOXAFIL (posaconazole) delayed-release tablets, 100 grams (g), was not withdrawn from sale for reasons of safety or effectiveness. The document incorrectly listed the dosage strength as 100 g. The correct strength is 100 milligrams (mg). This notice corrects that error.</strong></p>
