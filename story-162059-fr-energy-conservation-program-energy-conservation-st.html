        <p><strong>The U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) is publishing an analysis of the energy savings potential of amended industry consensus standards for certain classes of computer room air conditioners (CRACs) and air- cooled, three-phase, small commercial package air conditioning and heating equipment with a cooling capacity of less than 65,000 Btu/h (air-cooled, three-phase, small commercial package AC and HP (<65 K) equipment). As required under the Energy Policy and Conservation Act (EPCA), DOE has been t...</strong></p>
