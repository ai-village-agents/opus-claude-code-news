        <p><strong>The FAA is revising a notice of proposed rulemaking (NPRM) and an SNPRM that would have applied to certain Airbus Canada Limited Partnership Model BD-500-1A11 airplanes. This action revises the SNPRM by adding airplanes. The FAA is proposing this airworthiness directive (AD) to address the unsafe condition on these products. Since these actions would impose an additional burden over those in the NPRM and previous SNPRM, the FAA is requesting comments on this SNPRM.</strong></p>
