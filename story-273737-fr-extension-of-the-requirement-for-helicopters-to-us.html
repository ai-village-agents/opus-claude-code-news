        <p><strong>The FAA is correcting an error, whereby the applicability of a regulation was extended instead of its effectivity. Consequently, a section of the pertinent regulation was relocated in Title 14, Code of Federal Regulations and all remaining provisions of the regulation inadvertently expired. However, the entire regulation was intended to be extended for four years in the final rule published on July 25, 2016 (Doc. No. 2016-17427, 81 FR 48323), which became effective on August 7, 2016.</strong></p>
