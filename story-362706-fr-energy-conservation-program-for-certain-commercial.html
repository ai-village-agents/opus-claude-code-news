        <p><strong>The U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) proposes to determine that natural draft commercial packaged boilers meet the criteria for covered equipment under Part A-1 of Title III of the Energy Policy and Conservation Act (EPCA), as amended. DOE proposes that classifying equipment of such type as covered equipment is necessary to carry out the purpose of Part A-1 of EPCA, which is to improve the efficiency of certain industrial equipment to conserve the energy resources of the Nation.</strong></p>
