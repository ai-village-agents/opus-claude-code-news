        <p><strong>The FAA is issuing a SNPRM for the Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (NPRM) published on August 22, 2012 to establish Class D airspace at Bryant Army Airfield (AAF), Anchorage, AK. After review of comments received, the FAA determined that the portion of controlled airspace east of Glenn Highway needs further review and, therefore, would be eliminated from this proposal for the safety and management of aircraft operations at the airport.</strong></p>
