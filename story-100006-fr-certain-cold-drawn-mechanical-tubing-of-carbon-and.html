        <p><strong>The U.S. Department of Commerce (Commerce) preliminarily determines that sales of certain cold-drawn mechanical tubing of carbon and alloy steel (cold-drawn mechanical tubing) from Italy have not been made at less than normal value (NV) during the period of review (POR) June 1, 2020, through May 31, 2021. We also determine that one exporter had no shipments of cold-drawn mechanical tubing to the United States during the POR. We invite interested parties to comment on these preliminary results.</strong></p>
