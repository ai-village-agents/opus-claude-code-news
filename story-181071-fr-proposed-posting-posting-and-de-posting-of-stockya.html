    <div class="breaking">
        <p><strong>The Agricultural Marketing Service (AMS), USDA, is taking several actions to post and de-post stockyards under the Packers and Stockyards Act (P&S Act). Specifically, we are proposing that 10 stockyards now operating subject to the P&S Act be posted. We are also posting six stockyards that were identified previously as operating subject to the P&S Act and de-posting two stockyards that no longer meet the definition of a stockyard.</strong></p>
