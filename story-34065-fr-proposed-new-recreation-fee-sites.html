        <p><strong>The Humboldt-Toiyabe National Forest is proposing to establish several new recreation fee sites. Proposed new recreation fees collected at the proposed new recreation fee sites would be used for operation, maintenance, and improvement of the sites. An analysis of nearby recreation fee sites with similar amenities shows the proposed new recreation fees that would be charged at the proposed new recreation fee sites are reasonable and typical of similar recreation fee sites in the area.</strong></p>
