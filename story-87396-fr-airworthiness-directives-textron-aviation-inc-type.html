    <h1>BREAKING: Federal Register: Airworthiness Directives; Textron Aviation Inc. (Type Certificate Previously Held by Cessna Aircraft Company) Airplanes</h1>

    <div class="breaking">
        <p><strong>The FAA proposes to adopt a new airworthiness directive (AD) for certain Textron Aviation Inc. (Textron) Model 120 and 140 airplanes and all Model 140A airplanes. This proposed AD was prompted by reports of seat belt center bracket failures from overstress. This proposed AD would require determining if the seat belt center bracket is made of steel and replacing any non-steel brackets. The FAA is proposing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.</strong></p>
