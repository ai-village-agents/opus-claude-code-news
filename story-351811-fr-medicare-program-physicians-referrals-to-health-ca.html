        <p><strong>This proposed rule would revise the exception to the physician self-referral prohibition for certain arrangements involving the donation of electronic health records items and services. Specifically, it would extend the sunset date of the exception, remove the electronic prescribing capability requirement, and update the provision under which electronic health records technology is deemed interoperable. In addition, we are requesting public comment on other changes we are considering.</strong></p>
