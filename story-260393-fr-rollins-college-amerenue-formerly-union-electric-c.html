        <p><strong>With this notice, the Occupational Safety and Health Administration ("OSHA" or "the Agency") is making a technical amendment to an existing permanent variance, and revoking two others. The technical amendment involves updating the name of one employer granted a variance whose name has changed. The technical amendment and revocations result from an OSHA review to identify variances that are outdated, unnecessary, or otherwise defective.</strong></p>
