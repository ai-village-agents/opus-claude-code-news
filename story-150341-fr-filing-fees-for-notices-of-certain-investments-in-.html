        <p><strong>The interim rule establishes a fee for parties filing a formal written notice of a transaction for review by the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (CFIUS). In establishing a fee for such notices, this rule implements section 1723 of the Foreign Investment Risk Review Modernization Act of 2018, which amends section 721 of the Defense Production Act of 1950 to allow CFIUS to collect fees. This interim rule includes a request for additional public comment.</strong></p>
