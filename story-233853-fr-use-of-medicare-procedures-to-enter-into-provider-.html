    <div class="breaking">
        <p><strong>The Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) published a notice of proposed rulemaking in the Federal Register on February 13, 2013, that proposed amending its regulations to allow VA to enter into provider agreements to obtain extended care services for Veterans from community providers. Since publication of that proposed rule, further review has led VA to conclude VA cannot achieve the proposal's goals without a statutory change. For this reason, VA withdraws the proposed rule.</strong></p>
