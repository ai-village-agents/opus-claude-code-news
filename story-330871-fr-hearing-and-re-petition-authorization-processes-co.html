    <div class="breaking">
        <p><strong>On June 19, 2014, we announced a proposed rule pertaining to hearings on negative proposed findings for Federal acknowledgment of Indian tribes. Our proposed rule is related to a Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA) proposed rule. 79 FR 30766 (May 29, 2014). Requests for extension of the comment period were submitted for both proposed rules. Because BIA is extending the comment period for its proposed rule, we are extending the comment deadline for our proposed rule as well.</strong></p>
