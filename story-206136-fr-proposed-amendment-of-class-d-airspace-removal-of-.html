        <p><strong>This action proposes to amend Class D airspace, remove Class E airspace designated as an extension, and establish Class E airspace extending upward from 700 feet or more above the surface at Olive Branch Airport, Olive Branch, MS. The Olive Branch non-directional radio beacon (NDB) has been decommissioned, requiring the redesign of the airspace. This proposal would replace the outdated term Airport/ Facility Directory with the term Chart Supplement in the Class D legal description.</strong></p>
