        <p><strong>On August 20, 2013, NHTSA published a final rule amending its Early Warning Rule (EWR) with an effective date of August 20, 2014. On July 28, 2014, NHTSA published a rule which, in part, attempted to delay the effective date of the provisions until January 1, 2015. However, the information in the DATES section of the July 28 rule did not adequately project that action. This document corrects that error.</strong></p>
