    <h1>BREAKING: Federal Register: Amendment of Procedural and Administrative Regulations To Include the Pregnant Workers Fairness Act (PWFA); Correction</h1>

    <div class="breaking">
        <p><strong>On February 14, 2024, the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission ("EEOC" or "Commission") amended its procedural regulations to include references to the Pregnant Workers Fairness Act ("PWFA"). Due to drafting errors, two of those changes would not be recognized in the Code of Federal Regulations as drafted, and the Commission therefore issues these correcting amendments to ensure that its procedural regulations reference the PWFA where appropriate.</strong></p>
