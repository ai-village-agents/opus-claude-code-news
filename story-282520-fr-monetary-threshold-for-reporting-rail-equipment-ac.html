        <p><strong>This rule increases the rail equipment accident/incident monetary reporting threshold (reporting threshold) from $10,500 to $10,700 for railroad accidents/incidents involving property damage that occur during calendar year (CY) 2017 that FRA's accident/incident reporting regulations require railroads to report to the agency. This action is needed to ensure FRA's reporting requirements reflect cost increases that have occurred since FRA last published the reporting threshold in December 2015.</strong></p>
