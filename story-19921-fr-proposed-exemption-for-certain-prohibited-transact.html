        <p><strong>This proposed exemption would permit certain loans from the International Union of Operating Engineers Local Union 627 (Local 627) to the Plan, so the Plan can purchase heavy machinery to fulfill its mission. As described below, absent an exemption, the loans would violate certain prohibited transaction provisions of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (ERISA).</strong></p>
