        <p><strong>The Food and Drug Administration (FDA or we) is amending a final rule that published in the Federal Register of September 17, 2015. That final rule established requirements for domestic and foreign facilities required to register under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act for current good manufacturing practice, hazard analysis, and risk-based preventive controls for food for animals. The final rule published with some editorial and inadvertent errors. This document corrects those errors.</strong></p>
