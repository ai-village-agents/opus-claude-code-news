        <p><strong>The U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) received and is considering approval of four amendment requests. The amendment requests are for the Cooper Nuclear Station (CNS); Duane Arnold Energy Center (DAEC); and Browns Ferry Nuclear Plant (BFN), Units 1, 2, and 3. For each amendment request, the NRC proposes to determine that it involves no significant hazards consideration. In addition, each amendment request contains sensitive unclassified non-safeguards information (SUNSI).</strong></p>
