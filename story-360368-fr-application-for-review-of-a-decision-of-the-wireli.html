        <p><strong>In this document, the Federal Communications Commission (Commission), denies in part and dismisses in part an Application for Review filed by the Dooly County School System and rescinds the remaining interim filing procedures established by the Commission in the 2001 Interim Filing Procedures Order. These actions are needed to provide clarity and certainty as to the filing deadline for applications for review arising from Universal Service Administrative Company-related proceedings.</strong></p>
