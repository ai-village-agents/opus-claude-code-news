    <div class="breaking">
        <p><strong>The Bureau of Industry and Security (BIS) is correcting certain provisions of the Export Administration Regulations that were amended by two final rules appearing in the Federal Register on June 5, 2014 and on May 13, 2014. Both rules amended a number of the same provisions of the Export Administration Regulations, and certain language was either removed or changed inadvertently. This final rule corrects those provisions to accurately reflect the revisions made by both rules.</strong></p>
