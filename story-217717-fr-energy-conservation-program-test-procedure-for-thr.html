        <p><strong>The U.S. Department of Energy ("DOE") is initiating a data collection process through this request for information ("RFI") to consider whether to amend its test procedure for three-phase commercial air-cooled air conditioners and heat pumps with a cooling capacity of less than 65,000 British thermal units per hour ("Btu/h"). To inform interested parties and to facilitate this process, DOE has gathered data, identifying several issues associated with the currently applicable test procedures on wh...</strong></p>
