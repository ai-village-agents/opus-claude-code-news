        <p><strong>We, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (Service), propose to list the Miami tiger beetle (Cicindelidia floridana) as an endangered species throughout its range under the Endangered Species Act of 1973, as amended (Act). If we finalize this rule as proposed, it would extend the Act's protections to this species. This document also serves as the 90-day and 12-month findings on a petition to list the species as an endangered or threatened species.</strong></p>
