        <p><strong>This rule proposes to partially reopen several groundfish closed areas in the 2013 fishing year. If implemented as proposed, this action would open portions of Closed Areas I and II to selective fishing gear for a limited time period. Two areas within the Nantucket Lightship Closed Area are also proposed to be opened to selective gear year-round. The Western Gulf of Maine and Cashes Ledge Closed Areas, both located in the Gulf of Maine, would not be opened.</strong></p>
