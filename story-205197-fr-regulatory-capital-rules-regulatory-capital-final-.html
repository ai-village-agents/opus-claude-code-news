        <p><strong>The FDIC is issuing this technical amendment to return text to its regulations that was altered due to a procedural error that allowed a 2014 rule to become effective on January 1, 2018. FDIC did not intend for the 2014 rule to become effective but did not rescind it before its effective date. This rule returns text to a section on capital measures and capital category definitions as it appeared before the codification of the 2014 rule.</strong></p>
