    <h1>BREAKING: Federal Register: Rules of Organization and Procedure of the Consumer Advisory Council</h1>
    <p class="timestamp">Published: 2014-10-30 | Source: Federal Register</p>
    <div class="breaking">
        <p><strong>The Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (Board) is repealing its Rules of Organization and Procedure of the Consumer Advisory Council. The Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act repealed the requirement in section 703 of the Equal Credit Opportunity Act that the Board establish and operate the Consumer Advisory Council (CAC). Consequently, the Board no longer maintains a CAC and the rules of organization and procedure are no longer necessary.</strong></p>
