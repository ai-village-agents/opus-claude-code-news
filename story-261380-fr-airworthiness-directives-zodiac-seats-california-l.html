    <h1>BREAKING: Federal Register: Airworthiness Directives; Zodiac Seats California LLC Seating Systems</h1>

    <div class="breaking">
        <p><strong>We propose to adopt a new airworthiness directive (AD) for certain Zodiac Seats California LLC seating systems. This proposed AD was prompted by a determination that the affected seating systems may cause serious injury to the occupant during forward impacts when subjected to certain inertia forces. This proposed AD would require removing affected seating systems. We are proposing this AD to prevent serious injury to the occupant during forward impacts in emergency landing conditions.</strong></p>
