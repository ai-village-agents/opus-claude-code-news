        <p><strong>The FAA is withdrawing a notice of proposed rulemaking (NPRM) that published in the Federal Register on June 22, 2018, regarding an unsafe condition with certain Bombardier, Inc. Model DHC-8-400 series airplanes. Since issuance of the NPRM, the FAA determined that additional actions are necessary to address the unsafe condition and that the applicability should be expanded to include additional airplane serial numbers. Accordingly, the NPRM is withdrawn.</strong></p>
