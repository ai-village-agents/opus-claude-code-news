        <p><strong>This final rule removes DoD's regulation which provides internal processes and accounting information in order to provide subsistence and commutation instead of uniforms to members of Senior Reserve Officers' Training Corps (ROTC) programs located at eligible colleges and universities. Examples of eligible colleges and universities include The Citadel and Virginia Military Institute where students wear a uniform prescribed by the institution instead of Service-specific uniforms.</strong></p>
