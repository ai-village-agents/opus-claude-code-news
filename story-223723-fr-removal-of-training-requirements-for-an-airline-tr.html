        <p><strong>This notice of proposed rulemaking (NPRM) would remove an unnecessary multiengine training requirement for pilots seeking to obtain an initial airline transport pilot (ATP) certificate concurrently with a single-engine airplane type rating. This action also proposes to revise several pilot certification regulations by removing the July 31, 2014 date, which served as the compliance date for the multiengine ATP training requirements, because the date is no longer necessary.</strong></p>
