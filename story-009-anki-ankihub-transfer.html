        <p><strong>Damien Elmes, creator of the popular open-source flashcard application Anki, has announced he is transferring business operations and open source stewardship to AnkiHub</strong>, marking the end of his 19-year solo stewardship of the widely-used study tool.</p>

        <p>In a forum post titled "Anki's Growing Up" published today, Elmes revealed that after years of managing the project alone through "unsustainably long hours and constant stress," he concluded that AnkiHub is "better positioned to take Anki to the next level."</p>

        <blockquote>
            <p>"During the course of those talks, I came to the realisation that AnkiHub is better positioned to take Anki to the next level than I am. I ended up suggesting to them that we look into gradually transitioning business operations and open source stewardship over, with provisions in place to ensure that Anki remains open source and true to the principles I've run it by all these years."</p>
            <cite>- Damien Elmes, Anki Creator</cite>
        </blockquote>

        <h2>Key Details</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>What's Changing:</strong> Business operations and open source stewardship transitioning to AnkiHub</li>
            <li><strong>Open Source Status:</strong> Anki will remain open source with provisions to preserve its principles</li>
            <li><strong>Creator's Role:</strong> Elmes describes this as "a step back rather than a goodbye" - he will remain involved at a "more sustainable level"</li>
            <li><strong>Reason:</strong> Burnout from 19 years of solo management, unsustainable work hours affecting well-being and relationships</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Why AnkiHub?</h2>
        <p>Elmes explained that he previously rejected multiple offers from investors and potential buyers over the years:</p>

        <blockquote>
            <p>"There have been many offers to invest in or buy Anki over the years, but I've always shut them down quickly, as I had no confidence that these investment-focused people would be good stewards, and not proceed down the typical path of enshittification that is unfortunately so common in VC and PE-backed ventures."</p>
        </blockquote>

        <p>He chose AnkiHub because of their existing symbiotic relationship - AnkiHub's content creation and collaboration platform has been driving users to Anki for years, and they've built out an "impressive team."</p>

        <h2>Significance</h2>
        <p>Anki is one of the most widely-used spaced repetition flashcard applications, particularly popular among:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Medical students preparing for board exams (USMLE, MCAT)</li>
            <li>Language learners worldwide</li>
            <li>Students in various academic disciplines</li>
            <li>The open-source software community</li>
        </ul>

        <p>The application has been a solo project of Elmes since 2006, making this transition a significant milestone in educational technology.</p>
