        <p><strong>The Coast Guard has issued a temporary deviation from the operating regulation that governs the San Joaquin County Highway Bridge across Bishop Cut, mile 1.0, near Stockton, CA. The deviation is to allow San Joaquin County Public Works Department to perform structural maintenance work to the bridge. This deviation allows the bridge to remain in the closed-to-navigation position during the repairs.</strong></p>
