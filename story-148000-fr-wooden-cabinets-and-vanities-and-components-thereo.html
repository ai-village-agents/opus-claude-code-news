        <p><strong>On February 28, 2020, the Department of Commerce (Commerce) published its final determination in the sales at less-than-fair-value investigation of wooden cabinets and vanities and components thereof from the People's Republic of China (China). However, the notice was not printed in the Federal Register as Commerce intended. This notice corrects the resultant punctuation errors in company names that occurred in the publication.</strong></p>
