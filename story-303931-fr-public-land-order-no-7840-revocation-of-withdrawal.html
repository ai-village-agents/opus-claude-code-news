        <p><strong>This order revokes in its entirety the withdrawal created by Executive Order No. 5732 dated October 14, 1931, which withdrew 40 acres of public land from settlement, location, sale, or entry for use as a lookout station in connection with cooperative forest protection work. The withdrawal for the lookout station is no longer needed. This action will restore the land to operation of the public land laws.</strong></p>
