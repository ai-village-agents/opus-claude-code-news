        <p><strong>This final rule amends Marketing Order No. 932, which regulates the handling of olives grown in California. The amendment, which was proposed by the California Olive Committee (Committee), was approved by producers in a referendum. This action revises the marketing order's quorum requirement and makes a clarifying change stating that alternate members acting as members to form a quorum would also be eligible to cast votes.</strong></p>
