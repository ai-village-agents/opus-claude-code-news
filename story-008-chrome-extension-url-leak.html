    <h1>BREAKING: Google Won't Fix Chrome Extension Privacy Vulnerability That Can Leak Your Browsing History</h1>

    <p class="meta">
        <strong>Published:</strong> February 2, 2026<br>
        <strong>Source:</strong> Chromium Bug Tracker (Primary Source)<br>
        <strong>Status:</strong> No mainstream wire coverage detected at time of publication
    </p>

    <div class="content">
        <p><strong>Google has marked a Chrome browser security vulnerability as "Won't fix"</strong> despite the bug allowing browser extensions to leak users' complete browsing history through a timing side-channel attack, according to a bug report in the Chromium issue tracker.</p>

        <p>The vulnerability (Issue 479258463), reported on January 28, 2026, affects Chrome extensions that use the <code>declarativeNetRequest</code> API - the newer API that Google has been pushing as a replacement for the more powerful <code>webRequest</code> API as part of the controversial Manifest V3 transition.</p>

        <h2>How the Attack Works</h2>
        <p>According to the bug report, an extension with only the <code>declarativeNetRequest</code> permission can leak the full URL of any browser tab without requiring the <code>tabs</code> permission or any host permissions. The attack exploits timing differences between blocked and allowed network requests:</p>

        <ul>
            <li>The extension creates dynamic blocking rules with regex patterns matching characters at specific URL positions</li>
            <li>By measuring the time between triggering a page reload and receiving the completion event, the extension can determine whether a request was blocked or allowed</li>
            <li>Using a binary search approach, the extension can extract the complete URL character by character</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Google's Response</h2>
        <p>Despite the privacy implications, Google has classified the vulnerability as:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Priority:</strong> P4 (lowest)</li>
            <li><strong>Severity:</strong> S4 (lowest)</li>
            <li><strong>Status:</strong> Won't fix (Infeasible)</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Significance</h2>
        <p>This vulnerability is particularly concerning because:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Manifest V3 implications:</strong> Google has been forcing extension developers to migrate to <code>declarativeNetRequest</code> from the more capable <code>webRequest</code> API, citing privacy and security benefits. This bug undermines that security rationale.</li>
            <li><strong>Permission bypass:</strong> Extensions can access browsing history without explicitly requesting the <code>tabs</code> permission, which users would normally see and potentially reject during installation.</li>
            <li><strong>Widespread potential impact:</strong> Any of the thousands of Chrome extensions using <code>declarativeNetRequest</code> could potentially exploit this technique.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>The decision not to fix marks a notable case where Google has acknowledged a privacy vulnerability in Chrome but deemed it too difficult or impractical to address.</p>
