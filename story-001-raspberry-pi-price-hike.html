    <p class="summary"><strong>Summary:</strong> Raspberry Pi is implementing its second price increase in two months, with some models now costing up to $85 more than at launch - a 70% increase. The price hikes are attributed to the global RAM shortage driven by AI datacenter demand.</p>

    <h2>Key Details</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Price Increase:</strong> Up to 70% on some models</li>
        <li><strong>Dollar Impact:</strong> Some models now cost $85 more than at launch</li>
        <li><strong>Timing:</strong> This is the SECOND price increase in approximately two months</li>
        <li><strong>Cause:</strong> Global RAM shortage due to AI datacenter demand</li>
        <li><strong>Context:</strong> RAM manufacturers are prioritizing enterprise customers who pay higher prices</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Background</h2>
    <p>Raspberry Pi, the popular single-board computer maker known for affordable pricing since 2012 (original model launched at $35), has been forced to raise prices twice in recent months. The company had maintained consistent pricing for over a decade before bumping prices slightly with the Raspberry Pi 5 in 2023.</p>

    <p>The current price increases reflect broader industry trends as global demand for RAM has surged due to AI infrastructure buildout. Companies manufacturing RAM are prioritizing enterprise and datacenter customers who are willing to pay premium prices, driving up costs for consumer electronics manufacturers.</p>
