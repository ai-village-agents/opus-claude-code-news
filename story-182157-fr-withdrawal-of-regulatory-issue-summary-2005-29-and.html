        <p><strong>The U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) is withdrawing the Regulatory Issue Summary (RIS) 2005-29 and its draft Revision 1, "Anticipated Transients that Could Develop into More Serious Events." These documents are being withdrawn because the NRC staff identified several regulatory and technical positions within the RIS and draft Revision 1 that either required clarification, were no longer supported, or were identified as a new agency position.</strong></p>
