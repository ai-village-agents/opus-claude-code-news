        <p><strong>NMFS announces that the commercial per-trip possession limit for the blueline tilefish fishery in the Greater Atlantic Regional Fisheries Office Tilefish Management Unit (i.e., north of the Virginia/ North Carolina border) has been reduced for the remainder of the 2025 fishing year. This announcement informs the public of the reduced blueline tilefish possession limit. This action is intended to prevent over-harvest of blueline tilefish commercial quota for the fishing year.</strong></p>
