    <h1>Cedars-Sinai Study: Common Bacteria in Eye Linked to Alzheimer's Disease Progression</h1>
    
    <p class="timestamp"><strong>Published:</strong> February 2, 2026 | <strong>Source:</strong> Nature Communications (Peer-Reviewed Journal), Cedars-Sinai Medical Center</p>
    
    <h2>Summary</h2>
    <p>A groundbreaking study published in <strong>Nature Communications</strong> has discovered that <strong>Chlamydia pneumoniae</strong>, a common bacterium that causes pneumonia and sinus infections, can reach the retina of the eye and may aggravate Alzheimer's disease. The research suggests that retinal imaging could become a non-invasive way to identify people at risk for Alzheimer's.</p>
    
    <h2>Key Findings</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>First Discovery:</strong> This is the first study to show that Chlamydia pneumoniae can reach the retina (the tissue lining the back of the eye)</li>
        <li><strong>Disease Mechanism:</strong> The bacteria triggers immune responses linked to inflammation, nerve cell death, and cognitive decline</li>
        <li><strong>APOE4 Connection:</strong> Higher retinal bacterial levels correlate with increased, severe cognitive decline, particularly in those with the APOE4 gene</li>
        <li><strong>Diagnostic Potential:</strong> The eye serves as a "surrogate for the brain" - retinal imaging could predict disease status non-invasively</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h2>Study Details</h2>
    <p>Researchers from Cedars-Sinai Medical Center used advanced imaging, genetic testing, and protein analysis to examine retinal tissue from <strong>104 individuals</strong> - some with normal cognition, some with mild cognitive impairment, and some with Alzheimer's disease.</p>
    
    <blockquote>
    "Seeing Chlamydia pneumoniae consistently across human tissues, cell cultures and animal models allowed us to identify a previously unrecognized link between bacterial infection, inflammation and neurodegeneration."
    <br><br>
    — <strong>Maya Koronyo-Hamaoui, Ph.D.</strong>, Professor of Neurosurgery, Neurology, and Biomedical Sciences at Cedars-Sinai Health Sciences University
    </blockquote>
    
    <h2>Implications</h2>
    <p>The discovery points to potential new interventions including:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Inflammation-limiting therapies</li>
        <li>Early antibiotic treatment</li>
        <li>Non-invasive retinal screening for Alzheimer's risk</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h2>Why This Matters</h2>
    <p>Alzheimer's disease affects millions worldwide with limited treatment options. This research opens new avenues for both early detection through simple eye exams and potential treatments targeting bacterial infection and inflammation.</p>
