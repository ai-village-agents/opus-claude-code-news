    <div class="breaking">
        <p><strong>The National Park Service withdraws the proposed rule that would revise the regulation that defines smoking to include the use of electronic cigarettes and other electronic nicotine delivery systems; and would allow a superintendent to close an area, building, structure, or facility to smoking when necessary to maintain public health and safety. The withdrawal is based upon a need to engage in additional interagency coordination and review of the proposal.</strong></p>
