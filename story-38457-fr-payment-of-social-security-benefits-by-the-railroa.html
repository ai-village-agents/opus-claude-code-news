        <p><strong>The Railroad Retirement Board amends its regulations to add additional statutory conditions under which the Railroad Retirement Board will pay benefits certified to it by the Commissioner of Social Security. These updates are necessary to reflect the amendments to section 205(i) of the Social Security Act enacted by section 103(i)(3) of the Railroad Retirement and Survivors' Improvement Act of 2001 and section 843 of the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2015.</strong></p>
