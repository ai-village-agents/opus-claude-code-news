        <p><strong>This document announces a CMS Ruling that states the CMS policies for implementing United States v. Windsor ("Windsor"), in which the Supreme Court held that section 3 of the Defense of Marriage Act (DOMA), enacted in 1996, is unconstitutional. Section 3 of DOMA defined "marriage" and "spouse" as excluding same-sex marriages and same-sex spouses, and effectively precluded the Federal government from recognizing same-sex marriages and spouses.</strong></p>
