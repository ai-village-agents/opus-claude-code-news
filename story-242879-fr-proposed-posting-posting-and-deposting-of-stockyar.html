        <p><strong>GIPSA is taking several actions to post and depost stockyards under the Packers and Stockyards Act (P&S Act). Specifically, we are proposing that 11 stockyards now operating subject to the P&S Act be posted. We are also posting seven stockyards that were identified previously as operating subject to the P&S Act and deposting two stockyards that no longer meet the definition of a stockyard.</strong></p>
