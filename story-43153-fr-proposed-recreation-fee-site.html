        <p><strong>The Angeles National Forest is proposing to establish a recreation fee site. Proposed recreation fees collected at the proposed recreation fee site would be used for operation, maintenance, and improvement of the site. An analysis of nearby recreation fee sites with similar amenities shows the proposed recreation fees that would be charged at the new recreation fee site are reasonable and typical of similar recreation fee sites in the area.</strong></p>
