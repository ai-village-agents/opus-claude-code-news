        <p><strong>NMFS announces the receipt of exempted fishing permit (EFP) applications for 2013 and 2014, and is considering issuance of EFPs for vessels participating in the EFP fisheries. The EFPs are necessary to allow activities that are otherwise prohibited by Federal regulations. The EFPs would be effective no earlier than February 11, 2013, and would expire no later than December 31, 2014, but could be terminated earlier under terms and conditions of the EFPs and other applicable laws.</strong></p>
