        <p><strong>The Federal Communications Commission (FCC) published a document in the Federal Register on July 19, 2010 (75 FR 41767), revising Commission rules. This document was subsequently corrected by the FCC in the Federal Register published on August 3, 2010 (75 FR 45496). Both documents inadvertently failed to add footnote 2 to the correct entries in the table in Sec. 101.147(s)(7). In addition, certain entries are incorrect. This document corrects the final regulations by revising this section.</strong></p>
