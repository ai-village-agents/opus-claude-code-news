        <p><strong>On February 14, 2024, the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission ("EEOC" or "Commission") published an interim final rule amending its procedural and recordkeeping regulations to include references to the Pregnant Workers Fairness Act ("PWFA"). That document included a few references to the PWFA in sections where they should not have been included, and this document removes those references from the regulations.</strong></p>
