    <h1>BREAKING: Federal Register: Proposed Amendment and Establishment of Area Navigation (RNAV) Routes; South-Central Florida Metroplex Project</h1>
    <p class="timestamp">Published: 2020-06-16 | Source: Federal Register</p>
    <div class="breaking">
        <p><strong>This action proposes to amend two existing low altitude RNAV routes (T-routes), and establish nine new T-routes in support of the South-Central Florida Metroplex Project. The proposed changes would reduce the dependency of the National Airspace System (NAS) on ground- based navigational systems, and assist with the transition to a more efficient Performance Based Navigation (PBN) route structure.</strong></p>
