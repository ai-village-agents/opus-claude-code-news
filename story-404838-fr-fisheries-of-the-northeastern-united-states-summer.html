        <p><strong>On April 23, 2012, NMFS published in the Federal Register the final rule to implement the 2012 summer flounder, scup, and black sea bass specifications, which established commercial summer flounder allocations for each coastal state from North Carolina to Maine, and the summer flounder recreational harvest limit. Following publication, an error was identified in the commercial summer flounder quota and recreational harvest limit. This rule corrects that error.</strong></p>
