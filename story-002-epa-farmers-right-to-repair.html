    <h1>EPA Issues Right-to-Repair Guidance for Farmers, Clarifies Clean Air Act Does Not Restrict Equipment Repairs</h1>
    
    <p class="timestamp"><strong>Published:</strong> February 2, 2026 | <strong>Source:</strong> EPA.gov (Official Press Release)</p>
    
    <h2>Summary</h2>
    <p>The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) today issued official guidance clarifying that the Clean Air Act <strong>supports</strong> rather than restricts American farmers' right to repair their own farm and nonroad diesel equipment. The guidance makes clear that manufacturers can no longer use the Clean Air Act to justify limiting access to repair tools or software.</p>
    
    <h2>Key Points</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>EPA guidance clarifies the Clean Air Act supports farmers' ability to make repairs</li>
        <li>Manufacturers can no longer use CAA to justify limiting access to repair tools or software</li>
        <li>Expected to save farmers thousands of dollars in unnecessary repair costs</li>
        <li>Announcement supported by EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin, Agriculture Secretary Brooke L. Rollins, and Small Business Administrator Kelly Loeffler</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h2>Official Statements</h2>
    
    <blockquote>
        "EPA is proud to set the record straight and protect farmers. For far too long, manufacturers have wrongly used the Clean Air Act to monopolize the repair markets, hurting our farmers. Common sense is following the law as it is written, and that is what the Trump EPA is committed to doing. By protecting every American's right to repair, we're not just fixing devices, we're securing a stronger, more independent future for our country."
        <br><strong>— EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin</strong>
    </blockquote>
    
    <blockquote>
        "This is another win for American farmers and ranchers by the Trump Administration. By clarifying manufacturers can no longer use the Clean Air Act to justify limiting access to repair tools or software, we are reaffirming the lawful right of American farmers and equipment owners to repair their farm equipment."
        <br><strong>— Secretary of Agriculture Brooke L. Rollins</strong>
    </blockquote>
    
    <blockquote>
        "EPA's guidance affirming the Right to Repair will save our agricultural communities thousands of dollars by eliminating corporate middlemen and empowering farmers to fix their own equipment."
        <br><strong>— Small Business Administrator Kelly Loeffler</strong>
    </blockquote>
    
    <h2>Background</h2>
    <p>The right-to-repair movement has long argued that farmers and equipment owners should have access to the tools, software, and documentation needed to repair their own equipment. Equipment manufacturers have historically cited environmental regulations, including the Clean Air Act, as justification for restricting access to repair resources. Today's EPA guidance rejects that interpretation, stating the Clean Air Act does not prohibit farmers from repairing their own equipment.</p>
