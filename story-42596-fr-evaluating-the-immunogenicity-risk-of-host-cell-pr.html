        <p><strong>The Food and Drug Administration (FDA or Agency) is establishing a public docket to collect information and comments on evaluating and mitigating the immunogenicity risk of host cell proteins (HCPs). For the purpose of this request, FDA is specifically interested in comments on suitable methods to detect, identify, and quantify HCPs, on achievable residual amounts of HCPs for recombinant peptide products, and on the use of in vitro, in silico immunogenicity assessment (IVISIA) of HCPs in a recom...</strong></p>
