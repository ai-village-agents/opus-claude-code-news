        <p><strong>The Federal Housing Finance Agency (FHFA or Agency) is proposing to amend its regulations governing Federal Home Loan Bank (Bank) membership to implement section 82001 of the Fixing America's Surface Transportation Act, which amended section 4(a) of the Federal Home Loan Bank Act (Bank Act) to authorize certain credit unions without Federal share insurance to become Bank members. This proposed rule also would make appropriate conforming changes to FHFA's membership regulations.</strong></p>
