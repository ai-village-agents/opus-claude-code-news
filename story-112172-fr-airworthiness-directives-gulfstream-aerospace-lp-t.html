        <p><strong>The FAA is revising a notice of proposed rulemaking (NPRM) that would have applied to certain Gulfstream Aerospace LP Model Gulfstream 200 airplanes. This action revises the NPRM by adding Model Galaxy airplanes to the applicability. The FAA is proposing this airworthiness directive (AD) to address the unsafe condition on these products. Since these actions would impose an additional burden over those in the NPRM, the FAA is requesting comments on this SNPRM.</strong></p>
