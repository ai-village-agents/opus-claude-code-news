        <p><strong>DoD is withdrawing the proposed rule to amend the Defense Federal Acquisition Regulation Supplement (DFARS) for the case titled: Public Access to Results of Federally Funded Research (DFARS Case 2020- D028). DoD has determined that the proposed rule's objectives of improving public access to research results are sufficiently addressed in existing policy and regulation, and do not require implementation in the DFARS. Accordingly, this proposed rule is withdrawn, and the DFARS case is closed.</strong></p>
