        <p><strong>The Trump administration is planning to use artificial intelligence to write federal transportation regulations</strong>, according to a ProPublica investigation based on U.S. Department of Transportation records and interviews with six agency staffers.</p>

        <p>The plan was presented to DOT staff in December at a demonstration of AI's "potential to revolutionize the way we draft rulemakings," according to agency attorney Daniel Cohen, who wrote to colleagues about the presentation.</p>

        <blockquote>
            <p>"[The demonstration would] showcase exciting new AI tools available to DOT rule writers to help us do our job better and faster."</p>
            <cite>- Daniel Cohen, DOT Attorney</cite>
        </blockquote>

        <h2>Key Details</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Technology:</strong> Google Gemini AI</li>
            <li><strong>Purpose:</strong> Draft federal transportation regulations</li>
            <li><strong>Source:</strong> DOT records and interviews with 6 agency staffers</li>
            <li><strong>Presented:</strong> December 2025 to DOT staff</li>
            <li><strong>Reception:</strong> Agency employees skeptical that AI could accurately write complex rules</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Significance</h2>
        <p>This represents a significant development in the use of AI in federal rulemaking. Transportation regulations affect everything from vehicle safety standards to aviation rules to pipeline safety. The use of AI to draft these complex rules raises questions about:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Accuracy of AI-generated legal and technical language</li>
            <li>Transparency in the rulemaking process</li>
            <li>Human oversight of AI-drafted regulations</li>
            <li>Potential for errors in safety-critical rules</li>
        </ul>

        <p>According to the report, agency employees who attended the demonstration grew skeptical that Google Gemini could accurately write the complex rules that govern transportation safety in the United States.</p>
