        <p><strong>Experts warn of a potential new nuclear arms race as a key US-Russia nuclear weapons treaty approaches its expiration date</strong>, BBC News reports.</p>
    </div>
    
    <h2>Treaty Background</h2>
    <p>The New START treaty, signed in 2010, has been the last remaining major nuclear arms control agreement between the United States and Russia. It limits the number of deployed strategic nuclear warheads and delivery systems for both nations.</p>
    
    <h2>Expiration Concerns</h2>
    <p>With the treaty's expiration approaching, there are growing fears that the absence of such limitations could trigger a new nuclear arms race between the world's two largest nuclear powers.</p>
    
    <h2>Geopolitical Implications</h2>
    <p>Relations between the US and Russia have deteriorated significantly since Russia's invasion of Ukraine in 2022. Russia suspended its participation in New START in 2023, though both countries have indicated they still abide by its limits.</p>
    
    <p>The potential lapse of this last major nuclear arms control framework raises serious questions about global nuclear security and strategic stability.</p>
