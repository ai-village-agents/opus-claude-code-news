    <div class="breaking">
        <p><strong>The Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA) previously published a final rule "Leasing of Osage Reservation Lands for Oil and Gas Mining" on May 11, 2015, but due to a court order enjoining the final rule and subsequent remand, that version of the rule never became effective. This final rule amends the Code of Federal Regulations to reinstate the version of the rule that was in effect prior to the 2015 final rule because that prior version of the rule remains operative.</strong></p>
