        <p><strong>The Grain Inspection, Packers and Stockyards Administration (GIPSA) is taking several actions to post and depost stockyards under the Packers and Stockyards Act (P&S Act). Specifically, we are proposing that sixteen stockyards now operating subject to the P&S Act be posted. We are also posting eight stockyards that were identified previously as operating subject to the P&S Act. DATE: For the proposed posting of stockyards, we will consider comments that we receive by January 30, 2013.</strong></p>
