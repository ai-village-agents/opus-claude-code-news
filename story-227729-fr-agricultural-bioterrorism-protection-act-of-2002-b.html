        <p><strong>On January 19, 2017, we published a final rule amending the select agent and toxin regulations in several ways, including the addition of provisions to address the inactivation of select agents, provisions addressing biocontainment and biosafety, and clarification of regulatory language concerning security, training, incident response, and records. In this document, we are delaying the effective date of that final rule.</strong></p>
