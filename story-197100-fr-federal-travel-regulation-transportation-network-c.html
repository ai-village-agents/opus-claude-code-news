    <div class="breaking">
        <p><strong>GSA is amending the Federal Travel Regulation (FTR) by adding terms and definitions for "innovative mobility technology company", "taxi", and "transportation network company (TNC)", and designating "innovative mobility technology company" and "TNC" as forms of special conveyances. In addition, this direct final rule adds a due date by which agencies must report travel, transportation, and relocation costs and data to GSA. These actions are required by the Modernizing Government Travel Act.</strong></p>
